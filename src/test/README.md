# Liftoff-Capstone - Dog Sitting

# Overview
My project will be an application where users can create an account and sign in to use my dog sitting services. Users
will be able to add important information about their dogs. My application will also implement a calendar where users
can view days that are already booked and message me about ones that are not. I will also have a page where reviews can
be left and another where they can be viewed.
